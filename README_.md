**Exploratory Data Analysis on Automobile Dataset**

**Introduction:**

The dataset presented covers a range of automobiles and related
information to each entry. Through an exploratory data analysis, the
study attempted to find emerging trends within the dataset with a focus
on price paid for the vehicle and what exactly that amounted to in terms
of car specifications.

**Requirements:**

Python 3.x, Jupyter Notebook , Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn,
Missingno,

**Datasets**

The set covers 22 different brands of car as well as 5 different styles
of car within each brand.

**Results:**

Focus on correlation reveled further interesting points of analysis.
Price is more correlated with engine size and curb weight of the car.
Curb weight is mostly correlated with engine size, length, width and
wheel based which is expected as these adds up the weight of the car.
Wheel base is highly correlated with length and width of the car

As identified earlier the data presented a good opportunity to take a
closer look at 4 direct competitors in the market; Toyota, Nissan, Honda
and Subaru.

Within the four brands chosen what can be seen is that Toyota presents
the most cost-effective option taking all factors into account
